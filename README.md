## Setup

- Create an account on [www.coinpayments.net](https://www.coinpayments.net/index.php?ref=831b8d495071e5b0e1015486f5001150)
- Go to **My Account -> Coin Acceptance Settings**
- Check the coins you wish to accept.
  *  **Tips:**
    * You can setup your payment address, so you can use coinpayments as a pass thru service, rather then a cloud wallet (Payout mode ASAP/Nightly).
    * **Payout Made** (To Balance/ASAP/Nightly)
      * **To Balance:** Received payments are stored in your account for later withdrawal at your leisure. 
      * **ASAP:** Received payments are sent to the address you specify as soon as they are received and confirmed.
      * **Nightly:** Received payments are grouped together and sent daily (at approx. midnight EST GMT -0500). The main benefit of this options is it will save you coin TX fees
    * **Discount (%)**
      * **Positive Numbers:** Gives buyers a discount for paying with a coin. Good promotional tool if you want to give extra support to a particular coin.
      * **Negative Numbers:** Adds a certain percentage for paying with a coin. This could be used to cover your crypto/fiat conversation costs, make adjustments to match your local exchange, etc.
* Go to **My Account -> API Keys** , generate API key pair 
* Edit permissions on the generated **API KEY** and enable all options

<a name="ipn" />

## IPN ( Instant Payment Notification )
----
The IPN system will notify your server when you receive a payment and when a payment status changes. This is a easy and useful way to integrate our payments into your software to automate order completion.

IPN can be utilized in two ways using this lib.


[back to top](#table)

<a name="autoIPN" />

## Automated IPN ( for local development )
---
<span style="color: red"> Do not use this in ``PRODUCTION``</span>.
This method is used if you set the inital ``options.autoIpn`` to ``true``. This is unitizing ``getTxMulti`` to automatically query the server for payment statuses.

```javascript
var Coinpayments = require('coinpayments');

var client = new Coinpayments({
  key: process.env.COINPAYMENTS_API_KEY,
  secret: process.env.COINPAYMENTS_API_SECRET,
  autoIpn: true
});
                          
// client.createTransaction(...) Make transaction(s)

client.on('autoipn', function(data){
    // Handle data
    // data = getTxMulti
});
```
**General IPN rules**
- Reports only if partial or complete payment is made (partial payment is reported once and will report again if the partial amount received has increased or payment is complete)

- ``autoipn`` - Event fires every (default ``30`` seconds) after a transaction is made. ``data`` is equivalent to getTxMulti
- After all transactions are complete, autoipn stops until new transactions are in queue

[back to top](#table)

<a name="httpIPN" />

## IPN HTTP(S) POST
---
This is a coinpayments.net service to send HTTP(S) POST requests to the predefined or selected location. In order to enable this option go to **My Account -> Account Settings**, add **IPN secret** ( strong password, preferably hash ) and set **IPN URL** to where you will handle IPNs. 

On your server, you can use express middleware to handle incoming IPN POST requests, which is bundled up in this package. Here is an example server.
```javascript
let 
  CoinPayments = require('../lib'),
  express      = require('express'),
  bodyParser   = require('body-parser');
    
let app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

let events = CoinPayments.events;

let middleware = [
  CoinPayments.ipn({
    'merchantId': process.env.COINPAYMENTS_MERCHANT_ID,
    'merchantSecret': process.env.COINPAYMENTS_MERCHANT_SECRET
  }).middleware, 
  function (req, res, next) {
    // Handle via middleware
    console.log(req.body);
  }]

app.use('/', middleware);



// Handle via instance
CoinPayments.on('ipn_fail', function(data){
    // Handle failed transaction
    console.log("IPN FAIL");
    console.log(data);
});
CoinPayments.on('ipn_pending', function(data){
    // Handle pending payment
    console.log("IPN PENDING");
    console.log(data);
});
CoinPayments.on('ipn_complete', function(data){
    // Handle completed payment
    console.log("IPN COMPLETE");
    console.log(data);
});


// Handle via static field ( can be used in other files, aka no need to init )
events.on('ipn_fail', function(data){
    // Handle failed transaction
    console.log("IPN FAIL");
    console.log(data);
});
events.on('ipn_pending', function(data){
    // Handle pending payment
    console.log("IPN PENDING");
    console.log(data);
});
events.on('ipn_complete', function(data){
    // Handle completed payment
    console.log("IPN COMPLETE");
    console.log(data);
});

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 1337, () => {
  console.log("APP listening on port", process.env.PORT || 1337)
});
```
<a name="promiseipn" />

## IPN with custom handler + Promise
---
The ipn.verify returns a promise which fails in case the request was invalid for some reason. The reason is provided in  ``error.message`` . 

- ``success`` is true if the payment completed
- ``pending`` is true if the payment is pending and the funds are not delivered to the account yet.
- ``failed`` is true if the payment has failed (timeout, etc..)

```javascript
// Handle IPN with Promise
app.post("/mycustomurl", (req, res) => {
	let ipn = CoinPayments.ipn({
		'merchantId': process.env.COINPAYMENTS_MERCHANT_ID,
		'merchantSecret': process.env.COINPAYMENTS_MERCHANT_SECRET
	});
	
	// Retrieve HMAC from the request url
	ipn.verify(req.get("HMAC"), req.body).then( result => {
		if(result.success)
		{
			console.log("I got paid!");
		}
		
		if(result.pending)
		{
			console.log("My Payment is pending...");
		}

		if(result.failed)
		{
			console.log("My payment has failed");
		}
	}).catch( error => {
		console.log("Woops! Invalid request?! Reason:", error.message);
	});
});
```

**General IPN rules**
- Reports transactions that were just made (status=0) after that it reports any changes to the payment amount/ received confirmations and lastly completed transactions
- Errors are passed via ``next(err)`` in express. ``err === 'COINPAYMENTS_INVALID_REQUEST'``
- IPN Retries: If there is an error sending your server an IPN, we will retry up to 5 times. Because of this you are not guaranteed to receive every IPN (if all 5 tries fail) or that your server will receive them in order.

- ``ipn_fail`` - Payment failed/canceled
- ``ipn_pending`` - Partial payment report only
- ``ipn_complete`` - Payment complete
